first: 
    install recoil

second:
    import { RecoilRoot } from "recoil" then wrap  Component

third:
    create atom directory in main root and put your state in there

fourth:
    ctreate js file(like modalAtom) and import { atom } from "recoil";

fifth:
    in directory(modalAtom)
            export const modalState = atom({
                key:"modalState",
                default:false
            })

sixth:
    import modalState and  import { useRecoilState } from "recoil" where you want to use it.


seventh:
    in this app we want to manage modal state globally so, we define like this
    const [open, setOpen] = useRecoilState(modalState);
